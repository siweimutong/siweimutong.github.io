<div class="about-block about-block-en">
I'm currently a faculty member at the College of Computer Science, Beijing University of Technology, where I am engaged in teaching and research in the field of computer systems. His research interests include <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>computer architecture, real-time systems, real-time distributed services (RT-DDS), autonomous driving systems, and embodied intelligence systems</strong></span>. My research primarily focuses on the <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>formal modelling, timing analysis, and system-level optimisation of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and real-time systems</strong></span>, with an emphasis on execution determinism and performance predictability in complex computing systems operating on heterogeneous computing and communication platforms. My work addresses key challenges such as resource scheduling and allocation mechanisms, real-time communication and multi-source data consistency, as well as schedulability analysis and its engineering realisation. These studies target safety-critical and hard real-time application domains, including <span style="color:#1f6feb;"><strong>autonomous driving, robotic systems, and satellite systems</strong></span>, aiming to provide theoretically grounded and practically deployable approaches for real-time assurance and system optimisation in complex autonomous systems.
